                From neighborhood classics to hidden side streets, <u>Notting Hill</u> delights with its ability to both reassure and surprise me. Whether I go to browse the antiques market or sip a Tang-flavored cocktail in an underground bar, there’s something to discover every time. It’s easy to get here, too. The area is served by number of tube stations, including Notting Hill Gate in the south and Westbourne Park and Ladbroke Grove in the north. A lot of London buses also go through the neighborhood, and it’s a great place to walk to from Hyde Park, Kensington, and other parts of the city.
                One of the best things to do in Notting Hill is admire the rows of base <b>colorful houses</b> in the area. From absorbing the rainbow on Lancaster Road to reveling in the pastels on Chepstow Villas, the neighborhood’s bright hues always put me in a good mood. And that’s to say nothing of the cheerful tones on Westbourne Grove and Lonsdale Road. Notting Hill has some of the prettiest streets in London, and its colors play a big role. So does the endless array of antiques on offer at <b>Portobello Road Market.</b> The world’s largest antiques market, it has everything from vintage maps to your grandpa’s spectacles. There are over 1,000 dealers selling their goods here.

                Speaking of labyrinths, Notting Hill has some of the best mews in London. One of the most well-known is <em>St Luke’s Mews,</em> with its Instagram-worthy pink house, painted doors, and Notting Hill film fame. I also love walking down Colville Mews, which is home to colorful shops and picture-pretty homes. Streets like Pencombe Mews and Simon Close are worth peering into, too.

                    A lot of the mews are close to the best restaurants and cafes in the neighborhood. One of my favorite things to do in Notting Hill is explore the food scene, whether it’s stopping for the famous rose latte at <em>Farm Girl </em>or sitting down to dine at The Ledbury. Between those two ends of the spectrum, there are a lot of good places to eat in the area. E&O and Gail’s are classics, and Osteria Basilico has great ambiance. I always like getting cupcakes at The Hummingbird Bakery, too. But perhaps my favorite places to indulge in this part of the city are the bookshops. From Books for Cooks to The Notting Hill Bookshop and Lutyens & Rubinstein, the neighborhood has more good bookshops in a two-block radius than many areas of London have in total. The Notting Hill Bookshop is particularly popular, as it’s where the movie <u>Notting Hill</u> was filmed. It’s fun to walk in when I’m on <b>Blenheim Crescent</b> and replay all the scenes in my head.
